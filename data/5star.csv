The characters are complex, the filming rich with nuance, the music--jazz, blues--beyond compare. Other films have tried to pare music with drama, but most fail. The music seems an odd add-on; the characters a mere appendage. But Treme understands that without music there is no New Orleans. Those of us who lament the paucity of good drama on television should fear no more; those of us who lament the vacuity in many of the present movies in our cinemas still have much to regret.

All of us in this country have been impacted by it: it underscores much that we do or do not do, much that we say or do no say, much that we feel or believe we ought to feel. It is the blight that infects us all, though it also, as the film shows, and as James Baldwin and other writers manifest, can be the tale of resilience, human ingenuity, and love. !2 Years a Slave begins the process of showing slavery's horrors--you see the beatings, the misanthropy,  the day in and day out psychological warfare against African American people. It is difficult to watch, but slavery,  like the Holocaust, was horrific. We who live in slavery's shadow must see our past for what it is, for if we don't, we will continue to be mired in our present stasis: whites wondering why blacks are so angry; blacks wondering why whites are so naive. !2 Years a Salve is a beginning, a first step towards confronting the horror of slavery. The acting is superb; the suspense almost unbearable. Americans need to see this film.

Nifty! Kerry Greenwood, who's novels are adapted, calls this TV series ""Perfect"". Sets -locations- costumes -props, all the Bees Knees. Worth more than 5-stars, like Poirot, Downton Abbey, and Midsomer Murders. Ritzy 1920s Jazz included.Flapper Period Bliss! I'm hoping for a ten-season run.Phryne Fisher was a dame, brisk, but also innately kind, wealthy but hasn't lost the memory of her past poverty. She was heartwarming, sexy, funny, gutsy, intelligent, and late 29s modern-lady perfection. This arrogant, brash, flirt carried a .38, a diaphragm, and was a kleptomaniac with crime scene evidence items. Phryne (pronounced Fry-nee) was spiffily played by Essie Davis (Girl with a Pearl Earring). A PI, always a step ahead of the local cops, not unlike Poirot, Miss Marple, and Sherlock. Cops DI Jack (Nathan Page) and Constable Hugh (Hugo Johnstone-Burt -`Cloudstreet'); both deserved ""Hugo"" accolades. The last of the every episode cast was Dot (Ashleigh Cummings) a darling maid. All Aussies, like the production, but it was NOT Outback stereotyped.SDH SUBTITLES FOR 13 new episodes as well as nearly an episode-length of bonus.1 Murder Most Scandalous -PI Phrynbe's undercover fan dances while the Dep.Comm. is investigated for floozy murder.2 Death Comes Knocking -A seance is 1st clue to 2 WWI murders but Phryne asks vets for 1916 battlefield accounts.3 Dead Man's Chest - Burglary case turns to triple homicide and secrets beyond 'who-dun-it.'4 Deadweight -Fight throwing and illegal bets is sure to lead to a murder. See it ringside.5 Murder a la Mode -More to it than just murder via hairpin at a high fashion salon. Like ""House of Elliot"" a must own series.6 Marked for Murder -Is football captain hanging death suicide or foul play?7 Blood at the Wheel -When a female dies in a race car, Phryne gets behind the wheel.8 The Blood of Juana the Mad -A professor joins his anatomy class as the cadaver9 Framed for Murder -Silent movie leading man's death on-set in Phryne's own film investment. Can she direct too?10 Death on the Vine -Local town objects to Phryne's look into a pair of vineyard deaths.11 Dead Air -Another 3JH Radio Station incident--choked to death--but this time Jack's undercover.12 Unnatural Habits -What's happening at the convent that gets a wayward girl bound & drowned?13 Murder Under the Mistletoe -July Christmas in a chalet, but Father Christmas turns into the Grim Reaper; and a partridge in a pear tree.Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries 1",5.0,SEXY and mysterious and she stars in a crime series,1387584000,"12 21, 2013"

It was made with one idea in mind, showing just how tough Seals are and how brutal combat in Afganistan is.They do not pull punches. This is not your typical movie about American military might where the good guys overcome all odds and send the bad guys running. Make no mistakes, the Seals lose in this story. Many are killed, and worse than that (from the perspective of the Seals) is that the mission didn't get accomplished. This battle was an all out loss by the US. You don't see that in major film much.But that's the reality. In real life even the mighty United States Military and it's Spec Ops don't win every time. Most times, but not all. And when we lose it's brutal. This movie does a great job of showing how dangerous fighting the Taliban is. But it also shows how important it is and why men risk their lives to do it. And finally, it shows just how tough Navy Seals are. A normal person would have died 6 seconds into the initial attack from the wounds these guys suffered. Most of us would have been so crippled by the pain that we would have gone into shock and died almost immediately. But Seals don't feel pain or give up. They just keep pressing on until their bodies physically won't work anymore.It also shows that Seals aren't just dumb thugs with superior fire power and extra guts. They are not battlefield thugs. They are highly dedicated, smart, thinking, planning weapons. They know their enemy because they study their enemy until they know everything about them. They understand the place their emeny has in the larger scheme of the war. They are educated and precise. Not dumb and trigger happy.I spent 6 years in the Marines. I've worked with Seals. This is how these guys really are. They party hard when there's not work to be done.

237,1696948,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B00JV0547O,Robin Friedman,"[4, 4]","""Blue Ruin"", directed by Jeremy Saulnier, is a low-budget, award-winning thriller that develops Hatfield-McCoy related themes of revenge and violence.  Elliptical and spare, the film builds its tension throughout. The film features Saulnier's lifelong friend from the Washington, D.C. suburbs, Macon Blair, as the leading character, Dwight, who speaks relatively little during the film.  Blair captures his character with gestures, movement, dress, and his hauntingly expressive eyes.When the film opens, Dwight is homeless and leads the life of a beach bum while sleeping in his beat-up blue Bonneville. His life receives a bizarre form of purpose when he learns that the killer of his parents has been released from jail. Dwight's life suddenly becomes meaningful as he sets off to find and exact revenge on the killer. He has an intensity of purpose but little aptitude. He manages to kill his nemesis with a knife early in the film and then plunges into a feud to the death with the family of his victim, the Clelands. Dwight changes from a dirty, disheveled, bearded beach bum, to a clean-shaven, modestly dressed, and softly well-spoken would-be killer. The film includes a great deal of raw, painful violence, including a scene in which Dwight is struck by a cross-bow. Far from a polished killer, Dwight muddles through with many mistakes and errors in judgment.The film builds up a great deal of sympathy for Dwight and his quest while showing the futility and horror of revenge. His character, and his ineptitude for his chosen task, are developed throughout with emphasis on scenes between Dwight and his sister Kris and between Dwight and his loyal friend Ben who tries to teach Dwight to kill. The movie is set in the lower middle class areas of rural Virginia, with scenes of pawnshops, bars, abandoned railroad tracks, and amusement parks.  The sound track forms an integral part of the film, particularly an ironic song by Little Willie John celebrating the choices the singer has made in a hard life.A spare, taut and suspenseful noir-style film, ""Blue Ruin"" shows that talent and creativity can make something new from formulaic genres.Robin Friedman",5.0,Regeneration and Revenge in a New Thriller,1399248000,"05 5, 2014"
