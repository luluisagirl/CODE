4,1673209,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00FRILRRK,John's Horror Corner,"[3, 3]","Ninja (2009) was VERY entertaining but VERY flawed. This sequel strongly sets right and continues the franchise with crisper and more brutal fights, a better story and none of the nonsense--clearly opening the door to a most welcome third installment.Director Isaac Florentine (Undisputed II & III, Ninja) understandably likes working with (Scott Adkins; El Gringo, Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning, The Expendables 2, Assassination Games).  I get it.  Adkins is amazing and if I were directing martial arts movies he'd be my top pick, too&#8230;EVERY TIME!But Adkins' performances are easily limited by Florentine's vision that day.  Undisputed II (2006) featured some of the best fight choreography you can find and it was filmed with appropriate angles and for long enough time between cuts for viewers to really appreciate the techniques being executed and their difficulty.  It also had a simple, enjoyable (even if recycled) story.  Whereas Undisputed III (2010) suffered a drop in that quality in terms of both story and spin kicks for reasons I can't explain, and Ninja (2009)--however cool the movie was without the fights--failed to impress me with the martial arts&#8230;and I'm pretty sure that was the one thing (if only one thing) that should have wowed me.In this sequel Casey Bowman leaves runs to the store when his fianc&eacute;e has midnight cravings for chocolate and seaweed--we can assume she has the Japanese preggers munchies.  This all sounds very sweet, but you can't have a good ninja movie without a solid motive for revenge, can you?  So when he returns home to find her dead, no one is surprised.The opening combat sequence struck me as technically sound with crisp, impressive combinations.  However, Adkins' fight scenes seem largely limited by the skill of his stunt man opponents who (in a few scenes) can't nearly keep up, appearing to fight rigidly (i.e., being less comfortable with the choreography) compared to Adkins' deftly smooth counterstrikes so trained fighters and fight stunt snobs will pick at the weaker fight's flaws like piranhas  on a floating carcass.  This minor flaw was most apparent in a scene reminiscent of Jet Li's opening scene in Fist of Legend (1994), when Scott takes on a dojo of opponents.  But fear not.  This flaw was a one-fight fluke and the other fights remain enjoyably awesome.  Adkins fans will rejoice when seeing him deliver some of his trademark 540 check kicks, beautiful transitions when performing jump spin kick and sweep combinations, and stunning corkscrew flairs that would make Ray Parks' own Darth Maul green with envy.  You'll even notice moves and stunts that will smack of Jackie Chan, but with none of Chan's humor and all Adkins' elegant brutality.  And watch out for the &#34;hotel room&#34; fight scene.  I haven't seen such a brilliantly unique gun-disarm/counterstrike since Equilibrium (2002) and The Raid: Redemption (2011).The fights all find fury and brutality.  Spin kicks often serve as little more than &#34;filler&#34; in martial arts movies.  But when Scott Adkins throws spin kicks his body weight whips like a Devil-possessed trebuchet to our rejoice.Casey is unfocused and angry in this sequel, clearly preoccupied with revenge.  When he travels to Thailand to escape his grief, he is followed by the vengeance of an old enemy of his dojo; the same enemy that killed his fianc&eacute;e.  Casey travels to Myanmar to find Goro (Shun Sugata; Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2, Ichi the Killer, The Last Samurai), a Burmese drug lord and the man who wronged him.Tim Man (Kill'em All, Raging Phoenix) plays Goro's right hand man and give us a fantastic, long, vicious fight scene with Adkins.  The much shorter (yet sufficient) fight between Adkins' Casey and the aging but deadly Goro was also satisfying with a dash of unique flavor.The movie most clearly ends with a bitter end-- opening the door to a third installment in which Casey Bowman may finally find peace--and some fantastic swordplay.",4.0,"This sequel strongly sets right and continues the franchise with crisper & more brutal fights, a better story and less nonsense",1388966400,"01 6, 2014"

I would have liked it more had it not been so heavy-handed in so many ways. Based on a true story, it needed to have been told no matter how painful the message. Movie goers need a counterpoint to sanitized versions of slavery presented in films like Gone With the Wind. Slavery was evil and a blot on our nation's history. So many people suffered horrible indignities along with physical and psychological brutality in a supposed &#34;land of the free&#34; and most of that was wrought by Caucasians. It is a shame upon my race and rightly so. With that said, I feel the film lost some validity in telling it's powerful and painful story by painting almost every white person with negative strokes. You had to get to the end of the film before you encountered a white person with integrity, decency, and compassion. Even ones that seemed humane could not be trusted or believed. After a while it was like listening to a guard dog that barks at anything and everything. When you do need to heed the message you have become so numbed by the steady stream that you tune it out. I fear that 12 Years a Slave may have had that same affect to some and that is lamentable.",4.0,Good picture but...,1402704000,"06 14, 2014"

Season three (not yet released) and four is where this series really hits it's stride.Airing for 142 episodes (plus 4 TV movies) from 1988-1995, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT was a great crime/drama series that starred Carroll O'Conner as ""Chief 'Bill' Gillespie"" of the Sparta Police Department in Mississippi and centered on a lot of small town politics as well as catching criminals.

Susan (Anna Maxwell Martin) is shaken by her last adventure and reluctant to get involved in any more crime-solving, her anxiety compounded by her inability to explain her fears and frustrations to husband Timothy (Mark Dexter). Flamboyant Millie (Rachel Stirling) is putting her linguistic talents to use as a German translator. Lucy (Sophie Rundle) is now a clerical support officer at Scotland Yard. Jean, researcher and a kind of den mother to the younger women, still works as a librarian. The series has a new production designer but retains its even, muted lighting and brown tones that enhance the ""period"" look. Guy Burt has written two mysteries in four hour-long episodes this season. The mysteries are better than the hackneyed deviant serial killer of Series 1, though the characters suffer a little. The episodes are:In ""Blood on Their Hands"", Jean is disturbed to learn that a woman who worked under her at Bletchley Park, Alice Merren (Hattie Morahan), has been convicted of the murder of another former colleague, biologist John Richards (Paul McGann). Jean visits Alice in prison and comes away suspicious that Alice hasn't told what she knows about Richards' death and is protecting someone by refusing to defend herself in court. Jean enlists Lucy and Millie's help in investigating the murder case, which leads them to the apartment of 17-year-old Lizzie Lancaster (Faye Marsay), where they find some classified documents that Lancaster claims never to have seen before. Meanwhile, Susan's husband has gotten a promotion that may entail a 2-year posting abroad. Jean needs her help, but Susan feels she cannot get involved in an investigation that may place her family in danger. This is an interesting mystery, though Susan's character seems strained and a bit distasteful.""Uncustomed Goods"" sees Alice Merren trying to find work in spite of her notoriety. Millie has lost her job and is selling black market perfumes and stockings to make ends meet. Business takes a scary turn, however, when Millie is abducted by Maltese gangsters and detained until her boss in the black market goods business, Jasper (Rob Jarvis), comes up with the money that he owes his supplier, a criminal matriarch named Marta (Brana Bajic). Millie is further disturbed to learn that this crime family is in the white slavery business, luring young women from behind the Iron Curtain to come to Great Britain with promises of jobs as chambermaids, then selling the women as sex slaves to various hoteliers. Millie feels it is her responsibility to ensure that the crime ring is busted and the women freed. Millie seems uncharacteristically emotional, and the ruse she carries out with Jean strains credibility. The mystery plays into the current British moral panic over ""trafficking"".",4.0,"Still Stylish. Better Plots Than Series One, though Characters Not Quite As Strong.",1399680000,"05 10, 2014"

Let me clarify here that I'm NOT saying most Muslims are terrorists; I'm saying most terrorists are Muslims, and that's a FACT. The media and entertainment industry don't have the courage to associate Islam with terrorism, so they pick on Christianity, which is an easier target.And why is Christianity the easier target? Because Christians aren't retaliating with death threats, frivolous law suits, and violent rioting the way some Muslims do when Islam is insulted (e.g. riots around the world over Muhammad cartoons, death threats to Comedy Central for depicting Muhammad on South Park, the murder of the U.S. Ambassador in Benghazi, supposedly because of anti-Islamic movie trailers).Ironically, Christianity's PEACEFUL character is what makes it the primary target for bigoted, anti-religious attacks, even to the point of being associated with terrorism.

It has good twists and turns, interesting if flawed characters, and some decent suspense. What it lacks is a great killer. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the killer in this movie isn't going to put Michael Myers or Jason out of business. Also, only one of the death scenes really got a rise of me.

The movie does have some scary moments, and of course some jump scares. I do like the premise, and I was interested to see this movie, because it was directed by one of the VHS directors. The mystery in the film was pretty interesting. I like the fact that the husband is trying to figure out why his wife is not normal. The found footage in the movie was a bit scary at times. The only parts that annoy me were the jump scares that pop up. Is it as bad as the critics says it is, surprisingly it's not, so yeah I don't think it's a bad movie. Overall I say it's a decent horror movie, at least it was way better than The Devil Inside, that movie sucked. In my opinion this movie is good to watch at night.

He is joined by Adi Hasak in transforming his story 3 DAYS TO KILL in to a film. It is a mixed bag - not bad, not particularly good, but watchable because of the actors involved. The director is television director McG. The problem seems to be an attempt to be a father daughter mother reconciliation, dealing with metastasized brain cancer in a hired killer dependent on periodic injections of a experimental chemotherapeutic drug given at the hands of a super spy woman, and the taking down of the world's meanest criminals - supposedly the last job before our hired killer reconciles with his family to die of his cancer. Sound fun? Leave it to Kevin Costner to make it work.Ethan Renner (Kevin Costner), a dangerous international spy, is determined to give up his high stakes life to finally build a closer relationship with his estranged wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) and daughter Zooey (Hailee Steinfeld), whom he's previously kept at arm's length to keep out of danger. But first, he must complete one last mission - even if it means juggling the two toughest assignments yet: hunting down the world's most ruthless terrorists - The Wolf (Richard Sammel) and The Albino (T&oacute;mas Lemarquis) and looking after his teenage daughter for the first time in ten years, while his wife is out of town. The instigator of the action is the strange head of ideas Vivi Delay (Amber Heard) who elects to run Ethan's life as he tries to survive cancer and the flighty response of his daughter with whom he eventually forms a solid relationship through cutesy father/daughter means.Not a bad movie, a bit too long, a bit to sappy at times, but entertaining nevertheless.

Cofield,"[1, 1]","This Korean film with English subtitles seems specially designed to push our buttons by hitting established horror film themes: the creepy house or apartment; the mysterious stranger; the inexplicable slide from normality to brutal menace. Beyond that, however, Hide and Seek has a special menace, partly because it is set in a foreign land, and partly because the premise seems so weirdly possible.The main protagonist is Sung-soo, a comfortable middle class executive with a lovely wife and two small children.  He has a spacious apartment and a nice car but apparently suffers from a mild obsessive compulsive disorder, which is controlled with medication and plenty of patience.  Unfortunately, Sung-soo has an adopted brother who has much more serious problems.  When he gets a phone call from his brother's landlord reporting him missing, Sung-soo goes to the apartment complex looking for more information.  There he finds far more questions than answers, and he begins his own descent into darkness. What happens in the end is somewhat equivocal, and in true horror film fashion we are left with questions as to what, precisely, has been going on.This is a gritty film set in one of the most unpleasant slum areas that can be imagined.  In keeping with the established rules of the genre the over all mood is dark and brooding.
