But for an almost three hour film, I wanted to get to know Solomon more as a person, I would have loved to see the trials after he was freed again. I would've loved to seen more of his life and family before he was captured. But the brutality was all that was left. Hard to stomach violence and degradation only goes so far to create awareness. Maybe I'm out of touch, but this film wasn't anymore effective to me than Glory, Roots or even the ridiculous Django Unchained as far as purveying a message of deep inequality and on-going struggle.

I have seen most of the nominated movies and I am not sure who could have beaten that performance. I loved C. Ejiofor's performance as well.

This movie is similar to those 70s exploitation films made in the Philippines and often starring Pam Grier in terms of cheap bare sets and spare dialogue and kind of nonsensical but horrible situations.And then the contradictions in the storyline made me think that this is the companion to I Spit On Your Grave which was famous in my high school years but I never watched until about a year ago and I advise that everyone wait til they are older to watch that movie.There is NO WAY that anyone would star in I Spit On Your Grave out of narcissism.  I think it was an act of kindness on the part of the female lead to further expose the lies about rape and blaming the victim by really showing brutality towards someone so pretty that you would have to be a real dirtbag to hurt them.That's why Sarah Malukul Lane is cast because you just want to smooth her hair back and buy her a creamy cable knit sweater not hurt her as she is repeatedly hurt in this movie.PLUS the people who hurt her also offer her a helping hand because they LIKE her so that is definitely addressing the claims by rapists and mutilators that actually they just had a bad day or they actually lurve their victims.This movie is more than its nude scenes but those nude scenes say a lot about the actress willing to make them because throughout she is really nice as a person and very vulnerable and she keeps being hurt as if - as the Chinese say - the sky has no eye.It's kind of stunning that three movies together tell a tale, make a statement about rape and respond to the excuses and lies of rapists and those who are pro-rape.In order, you should watchI Spit On Your GraveK-11 for Portia Doubleday's performanceand finally this movie, Jailbait.",3.0,the third in a tryptich about educating us on the lies about rape,1402704000,"06 14, 2014"

Most of the dead people he sees are harmless and just annoying but when a stranger shows up with a group of ghost bodachs Odd knows that is up to him to stop them. Along with his girlfriend Stormy and the sheriff (Dafoe) Odd must stop the destruction before it's too late. Before I begin I should say that I have never read the book so I didn't know what to expect from this going in. The movie itself wasn't that bad but it did have one problem. A movie like this with this subject matter shouldn't take itself as serious as it did. Movies like Dylan Dog, Dead Before Dawn and R.I.P.D. all have the same basic idea and they were all more comedy then anything which made them cheesy but watchable. This one stayed away from the comedy aspect and I think that hurt it, to me anyway. I think that trying to be a straight action/horror movie wasn't the way to take this one. Overall, a movie that was OK but I think suffered by taking itself too seriously. I give this a B-.",3.0,Being a straight action/horror movie wasn't the way to take this.

Few scenes of violence,but overall, the production quality was good and the acting was beliveable...the film goes to show,.. when you mess with a persons family....you never know how that person will react...it reminds of a true story i herd about the Suaerwald family in austrialia...how the father bullied the wrong person and ,...ultimately the whole family had to pay the price for their fathers mistake.....its crazy world out thare!!!! Pretty much boring***  if you have to watch something...rent , dont buy this one,you most likely will not want to watch it again an again!",3.0,"THIS IS A STORY ABOUT A MAN WHOS PAIN,..
